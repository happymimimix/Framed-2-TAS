## Framed 2 TAS
### A macro that can automatically complete all of Framed 2 as fast as possible. 


## Notice: 

The cutscene at where the girl fall down from the tower has been cut in Framed Collection. 

This is the incomplete video from Framed Collection:

This is the full video from the original IOS version:

I have no idea why they did that, it make completely no sense! 

I don't count that as completing **ALL** of Framed 2.
